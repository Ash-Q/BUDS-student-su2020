    "    Your caloric intake vs. your weight.\n",
    "    Your eye color vs. your relatives’ eye colors.\n",
    "    The amount of time you study vs. your GPA.\n",
    "    Alcohol consumed vs. your blood alcohol content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of data that have a low correlation (or none at all):\n",

    "    Your sexual preference vs. the type of cereal you eat.\n",

As simple as this is, this is correlation and prediction at work: time of semester vs. the number of seats available in Moffitt Floor 5. This is exacltly what we are going in this lecture -- **the correlation coefficient simply assigns a number to the *type* and *strength* of a relationship between two events**."

These values are simply empty values that appear when we do not have a value available for a particular record. It is important to clean these meaningless values to carry out analysis of the dataset. Much of data science consists of **cleaning data** which includes **renaming columns**, **reducing the table size to include only the columns of interest**, and **removing missing values**.
